# MARS-Praktikum

## Overview
This repository is a collection of Python scripts implementing basic CAD algorithms from scratch, developed during [an internship at KIT](https://geom.ivd.kit.edu/ss18_1362.php). It covers a range of topics from curve interpolation to surface generation and interactive modeling.

## Features

### Curves
- **Interpolation with Cubic B-Splines (a1)**: An introduction to B-Spline theory, demonstrating spline creation through given points using the de Boor algorithm.
- **Periodic Spline Interpolation (a2)**: Techniques for interpolating and approximating closed curves, useful in scenarios like circle approximation.
- **Parallel Curves (a3)**: Methodology for approximating parallel curves of integral splines, essential in pattern creation and milling path determination.

### Surfaces
- **Rotational and Tensor Product Surfaces (a4)**: Exploration of tensor product surfaces, including the creation of rotational and shift surfaces. Visualizations are facilitated through geomview.

### Interactive Modeling
- **Triangular Mesh Algorithms (a5-a6)**: Implementation of different algorithms for triangular meshes, enhancing interactive modeling capabilities.
